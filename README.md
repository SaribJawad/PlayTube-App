# PlayTube - A YouTube-like Full Stack Application

**PlayTube** is a full-stack video-sharing platform built using modern web technologies. The frontend is developed with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. It utilizes React Query for server state management and Redux for app state handling. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with bcryptjs for password encryption. Cloudinary is used for storing media files, while JWT ensures secure authentication and login.

**Note:** The application is not live yet; I am currently working on deploying it using serverless architecture on AWS Lambda.

## Technologies:
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Redux
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcryptjs (for password encryption)
